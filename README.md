# Crack Detection using Machine Learning and CNN.

## Introduction

Welcome to my repository! This project was made by me as part of my DEC(Data engineering concepts) subject in third year of Btech.

This is my first ever data sceince related project and I learned a lot during this. I Decided to document the project on here. Some of the things I learned while making this project are
-Exploratory data analysis
-How to handle data, particularly image data
-How to work with the terminal and files
-I got familiar with JupyterLab and used it as my coding environment.
-

Different libraries involved in machine learning(tensorflowThis project focuses on implementing a crack detection system using Machine Learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to automatically identify and localize cracks in images, making it a valuable tool for infrastructure maintenance and safety.

Key takeaways:
Problem solving
being persistent 
critical thinking

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the algorithm, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- TensorFlow (version 2.0 or higher)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib
